if you don't like moving your hand to the shift button and hold it to get capital letters this is for YOOU


what this script does is it changes space button function like

first press = space button

second press = shift down

third press = shift up

forth and so on = spaces


and this cycle can be broken by pressing anything else other than space button itself
